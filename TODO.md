    [] - the indexing should be a summary rather than a full document content embedding
    [] - figure out a way to index files more efficiently in this current setup
    [] -we need a better way to represent the indexed files
    [] - the state management of the indexing process, the loading of the files and the indexing process is not accurate,
    the indexing process should first make sure all the files are read only and if there are other file types they can just have their titles and type indexed 
    [] - there should be a way to remove the indexed files or ignore some files from the indexing process
    [] -we also wanna implement agentic features with chat window, that can perform organisation tasks such as renaming folders, shifting files to other folders, deleting files, etc all through structured output for the agent using terminal commands
