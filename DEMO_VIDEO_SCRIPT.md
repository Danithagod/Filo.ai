## Opening (0:00 - 0:25)

**[Visual: Filo logo animation. Text overlay: "Built with Flutter + Serverpod"]**

**Narrator:** "Meet Filo - your personal AI butler for local files, built with Flutter and Serverpod."

**[Visual: App launching on desktop. Clean home screen with hero logo and search bar. Brief flash of tech stack badge.]**

**Narrator:** "Filo solves a universal problem: finding files on your computer. Instead of searching by filename, Filo lets you search by meaning - using semantic search powered by Serverpod's backend."

---

## Scene 1: Semantic Search (0:25 - 0:55)

**[Visual: User clicks in search bar. Types: "Find my financial documents from last year"]**

**Narrator:** "With Filo, you search the way you think. Just ask naturally, and Filo understands what you need - not just matching keywords, but actually understanding the meaning behind your words."

**[Visual: Search results appearing with relevance scores. Showing PDFs, spreadsheets, various document types.]**

**Narrator:** "Results appear instantly, ranked by relevance. Bank statements, tax documents, receipts - all found even if the words 'financial' or 'last year' never appeared in the filename."

**[Visual: User hovers over a result - preview tooltip shows file contents. Clicks a file, full preview pane opens.]**

**Narrator:** "Preview any file instantly without opening the original application. Filo extracts and displays content right in the app."

**[Visual: User applies filter - file type dropdown set to "Documents only". Results refine.]**

**Narrator:** "Need to narrow down? Apply filters by file type, date range, or tags to find exactly what you're looking for."

---

## Scene 2: AI Chat Assistant (0:55 - 1:30)

**[Visual: User clicks Chat tab in bottom navigation. Chat screen opens with welcome carousel.]**

**Narrator:** "But Filo is more than just search. It's an intelligent assistant that can actually help you work with your files."

**[Visual: User types: "Summarize the key points from my project notes"]**

**Narrator:** "Ask Filo to analyze, summarize, or extract insights from your documents. Watch as AI processes your request and responds in real-time."

**[Visual: AI response streaming in with structured formatted output. Bullet points, clear sections.]**

**Narrator:** "Get accurate answers based on your actual files, with responses formatted for easy reading."

**[Visual: User clicks attachment icon, selects a PDF. Chats: "What are the main action items in this document?"]**

**Narrator:** "Attach specific files for deeper analysis. Filo reads, understands, and helps you work with your content."

**[Visual: Quick action chips appear below chat - "Copy", "Save to notes", "Search related files"]**

**Narrator:** "Take action directly from the chat. Copy responses, save notes, or find related files with one click."

---

## Scene 3: Serverpod Backend & Real-Time Features (1:30 - 1:55)

**[Visual: Split screen showing Flutter app on left, Serverpod console/backend on right.]**

**Narrator:** "Here's where Serverpod shines. The backend handles real-time streaming AI responses, manages file indexing, and coordinates all the heavy lifting."

**[Visual: User types a complex query. Serverpod console shows request being processed, vector search being performed, results streaming back.]**

**Narrator:** "Watch the real-time communication. Serverpod streams AI responses, performs vector similarity search, and manages the entire conversation state - all handled by Dart on both ends."

**[Visual: Dashboard showing index health, connected server status, real-time sync indicators.]**

**Narrator:** "The Flutter UI stays responsive because Serverpod handles the asynchronous operations efficiently. File changes are detected and indexed automatically in the background."

---

## Scene 4: Dashboard & Control (1:55 - 2:25)

**[Visual: User clicks Home tab. Dashboard with stats cards appears.]**

**Narrator:** "Stay in control with comprehensive dashboards. See exactly what's indexed, monitor AI usage, and track costs across different models."

**[Visual: Camera pans to Index Health card. Shows "2,847 files indexed", "Last sync: 2 minutes ago", Green health indicator.]**

**Narrator:** "Index health monitoring ensures your files stay up-to-date automatically. Filo watches for changes and re-indexes in the background."

**[Visual: AI Cost Dashboard. Bar chart showing usage by model. "This month: $0.47"]**

**Narrator:** "Transparent AI cost tracking lets you see exactly what you're spending. Filo optimizes model selection to balance quality and cost."

**[Visual: Error Breakdown widget. Shows "3 warnings" with details.]**

**Narrator:** "Stay informed with detailed error tracking. Know exactly which files couldn't be indexed and why."

---

## Scene 5: Cross-Platform & Privacy (2:25 - 2:45)

**[Visual: Montage showing Filo running on Windows, macOS, and Linux.]**

**Narrator:** "Built with Flutter, Filo runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux - the same powerful experience across all your desktop machines."

**[Visual: Settings screen. Privacy-focused settings highlighted. Brief shot of local database/storage indicator.]**

**Narrator:** "Your files stay on your device. Filo indexes locally and only sends what's necessary for AI processing. Your privacy comes first."

---

## Closing (2:45 - 3:00)

**[Visual: Clean Filo logo centered. Text overlays: "Built with Flutter", "Powered by Serverpod". Tagline: "Your files, finally understood."]**

**Narrator:** "Filo - your Flutter Butler that makes file management effortless. Semantic search, AI assistance, and full control - built entirely with Dart."

**[Visual: Devpost/GitHub icons appear. Text: "Try it yourself - code available on GitHub"]**

**Narrator:** "Thank you for watching."
